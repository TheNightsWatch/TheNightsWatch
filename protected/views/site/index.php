<blockquote style="font-style:italic;text-align:justify;"><p>Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my banishment. I shall take no mate, hold no lands, render no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all nights to come.</p></blockquote>
