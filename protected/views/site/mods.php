<p>We don't recommend installing mods manually, instead, please install one of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="<?php echo $this->createUrl('site/magicDownload'); ?>">Night's Watch Minecraft Client [Windows Only (Mac version coming) - 1.3.2]</a></li>
    <li><a href="<?php echo $this->createUrl('site/modDownload'); ?>">Night's Watch Jar [1.3.2]</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There are several modifications that are recommended by the Council in order to best play MineZ and for best activity within the Watch:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/939149-">Magic Launcher</a> - Not a Mod, the tool we're auto-pacakaging to make running a breeze</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/249637-">Optifine</a> - Improves Minecraft Performance</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/75440-">ModLoader</a> - A mod that helps other mods.  Most mods you install will need this.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/482147-">Rei's Minimap</a> - Shows the miniature map that most other MineZ players use.  Allows you to set waypoints.</li>

    <li><a href="http://minez.jbakies.com/">MineZ Tacticul HUD</a> - A mod that shows your armor, status effects, and arrow count on screen</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.minecapes.net/">MineCapes</a> - Set your own cape and see your friends'.</li>
    <li><a href="<?php echo Yii::app()->request->baseUrl ?>/other/nightswatch.zip">Night's Watch Mods</a> [for 1.3.2] - Adds the Night's Watch cape &amp; shows you on the live map.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Notes about using on MineZ:</strong></p>
<p>All of the above mods are currently all allowed on the MineZ servers. If you see ANYTHING about ANY of these mods not being allowed, TELL US RIGHT AWAY. We do not want to be encouraging users to use illegal mods.</p>

<p><strong>If the JAR is not working for you:</strong></p>
<p>First, make sure your ".minecraft/mods" folder has no .ZIP files in it. If it does, we assume you know what you are doing and you are on you own. Otherwise, please goto all the threads/website for these and read all the FAQs for them and see if any of those problems cover yours. If you are still having problems and Minecraft is crashing, run Minecraft, and right AFTER it crashes, open ".minecraft/crash-reports/" and mod mail us on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTheNightsWatch">/r/TheNightsWatch</a> with what you were doing in the game to cause it to crash. There is no promise we can help fix you problems.</p>

<p><strong>Add your own mods:</strong></p>
<p>If you have any recommendations to add to this list or need help adding other mods to your own client, mod mail us on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTheNightsWatch">/r/TheNightsWatch</a> and Angellus_Mortis will help you. Note: we will NOT help you install mods that are illegal on the MineZ servers.</p>

<p>The Night's Watch did not write any of this code, nor do we own it. We are just giving it out to help our members.
